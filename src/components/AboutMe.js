      <p class="subtitle is-6">I am just a ward-of-state guy doing its own thing. I am passionate about technical creativity and innovations especially in the accessibility and inclusion space. I have had the privilege of working with various companies, universities, and non-profits with each facing the same challenges - how to make digital content more inclusive for Deaf invividuals. For that reason, I have armed myself with all the skills necessary to make it happen. However, my skills are not Deaf-centric limited but beyond as you can see in my portfolio. Feel free to reach out for more. </p>
